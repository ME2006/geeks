 # the problem explination:
    Given an integer N. Your task is to check if the integer is greater than, less than or equal to 5.
    - If the integer is greater than 5, then print "Greater than 5" (without quotes).
    - If the integer is less than 5, then print "Less than 5".
    - If the integer is equal to 5, then print "Equal to 5".


## explaining the solution

- to solve the problem :
 1st - i started by seeing if the input number is greater than 5 which will return "greater than 5"
 2nd - i made an else if statement to return "less than 5" if the input number was less than 5
 3rd - i made the code return "equal to 5" if none of the statements were right
